## Overview

The Nautobot Version Control app brings version control to the [Nautobot](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot) open source Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform. 

Nautobot provides a number of features to validate its data model and safeguard network configuration from errors. Adding database versioning provides another layer of assurance by enabling human review of proposed changes to production data, use of automated testing pipelines, and database rollback in the case of errors. 

The database versioning is made possible by the use of a [Dolt](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt) database. Dolt is a MySQL-compatible SQL database that you can fork, clone, branch, merge, push and pull just like a Git repository.

Doltâ€™s *branch* and *merge* versioning model allows operators to safely modify the data model on feature branches, merging to production only after validation is complete.


### Screenshots

> Developer Note: Add any representative screenshots of the App in action. These images should also be added to the `docs/user/app_use_cases.md` section.

> Developer Note: Place the files in the `docs/images/` folder and link them using only full URLs from GitHub, for example: `![Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautobot/nautobot-plugin-version-control/develop/docs/images/plugin-overview.png)`. This absolute static linking is required to ensure the README renders properly in GitHub, the docs site, and any other external sites like PyPI.

More screenshots can be found in the [Using the App](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/nautobot-version-control/en/latest/user/app_use_cases/) page in the documentation. Here's a quick overview of some of the plugin's added functionality:
